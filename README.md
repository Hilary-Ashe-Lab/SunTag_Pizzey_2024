# SunTag_Pizzey_2024
Code to accompany the following paper, "Exploiting the SunTag system to study the developmental regulation of mRNA translation".

These scripts are for analysing single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridisation (smFISH) and IF imaging data generated by the SunTag imaging system to visualise translation.

Scripts included are as follows:

- ribosome_number_JL.ipynb calculates the number of ribosomes present on an actively translating mRNA (Figures 2C, 2D and 4D).

- sog_ng_intensity_analysis_JL.ipynb analyses the distribution and intensity of translation sites across the expression domain of sog (Figure 5D).

All scripts require user input of filepaths to input data, voxel dimensions of the specific images analysed and filepath for the output summary data.

For further details, please see the above paper.
